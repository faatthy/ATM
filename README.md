# ATM
ATM Project Software By C++
# Problem Description:
You are required to design a program for a banking system. The program should
interactively deal with the ATM user and provide different banking services.
# Code Structure:
You are required to construct a class named ATM; this class has the following members:
Variables: (Note: for string variable use only C-style strings)
Account name: holds the name of this account owner, which is of maximum 100 letters.
Card number: the card number of this account, which consists of 10 numbers
Amount: the amount of money in the account
Functions:
create_new_acc(): this member function is used to create a new account, entering the
name and the card number
Deposit(): this function adds the deposited amount to the money in the account + 1% of the
deposited amount added
Withdrawal(): this function withdraw money from the money in the account + 3% deduced
from the account
Transfer(): this function transfers money from a sending account to a receiving account,
deducing 1.5% from both accounts
Print_acc_data(): prints the account name, card number, and amount of money
# Constants and Equations:
- The maximum number of accounts is 100 accounts
- When depositing, an extra 1% of the depositing amount is added to the account
- When withdrawing, an extra 3% of the withdrawn amount is deduced from the account
- When transfer, each user has 1.5% deduced from each account
- The program should interactively deal with the ATM user, until the user requests to
terminate the program (see the program flow in the video and this link, you are required to
exactly follow the data printed and how theyâ€™re printed, marks might be deduced to not
following that)
